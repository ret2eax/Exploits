# Exploits

This repository contains some exploits I have written for various bugs (some of these exploits are ancient and vanilla, they are indexed here regardless). 

Typically, moving forward, my exploits will predominantly aim to be those pertaining to browser and (maybe) iOS and Android exploitation (with exception). Alongside my own written exploits that corroborate with identified bugs that are actively being exploited in the wild. For more information on the latter, refer to CISAs [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
