## Overview

[IN PROGRESS]

[CVE-2023-3079](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3079) is a logic issue in Chrome's V8 `Inline Cache` subsystem, procedure `KeyedStorelC::StoreElementHandler`. 

The presence of deficient code in this context resulted in the omission of consideration for the 
fast packed elements kind on receiver and generated incorrect builtin code for storing into keyed array elements, leading to type confusion.

This bug has been patched in versions `114.0.5735.106-110` onwards at [commit e144f3b](https://github.com/v8/v8/commit/e144f3b). More details [here](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4584248) and on the [chromium bug tracker](https://crbug.com/1450481). There's also a [gist](https://gist.github.com/MaxBWMinRTT/bd47b17cac9eef20efe3040b5a50e043) that has some notes around this which may be worth looking at.

<!--Revert to commit `68903e142b1a554df821a78a420b7777aadb9cc9` for testing -> V8 version `11.4.183.17`.
